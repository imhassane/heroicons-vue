# Heroicons for Vue

This project is just a Vue js version of the icons made by [@sschoger](https://github.com/sschoger). You can find them in 
this repository if you are interessed only with the original icons [here (heroicons ui)](https://github.com/sschoger/heroicons-ui/).
<br />
I made them because I'm a huge Vue js fan and sometimes I need some icons to work with. He provided beautiful icons that I wanted to use within vue js easily.
<br />

### Evolution
At this point, I've made 16 icons out of 104.
